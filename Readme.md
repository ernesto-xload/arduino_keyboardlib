Arduino Keyboard library with multiple layout support
=====================================================

Based on Arduino Keyboard library 1.0.1

This library allows an Arduino board with USB capabilites to act as a Keyboard.

For more information about this library please visit https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/

Modified by Ernesto Sanchez to support multiple keyboard layout

Supported layouts:
* be_be
* cz_cz
* da_dk
* de_de
* en_us (default)
* es_es
* fi_fi
* fr_fr
* it_it
* pt_pt
* tr_tr

__NOTE:__ Only en_us and es_es are tested at june 2017.

Download and installation
=========================
- Click "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP"
- Unzip downloaded file in Arduino/libraries/ directory

Use
===
To configure the keyboard layout you must edit ArduinoKeyboardLib.h and modify #define kbd_lang line

Example:
```
#define kbd_es_es
```

You can use:
* kbd_be_be
* kbd_cz_cz
* kbd_da_dk
* kbd_de_de
* kbd_en_us
* kbd_es_es
* kbd_fi_fi
* kbd_fr_fr
* kbd_it_it
* kbd_pt_pt
* kbd_tr_tr

If none is especified en_us is used by default.
